# Utilities for MetaSounds (5.3 compatible)
 As of 04/07/2024, includes MetaSound nodes for equal power crossfading, crossfade by parameter, simple fade in and simple fade out.<br />
 Create a folder called 'Plugins' in the same folder where your UPROJECT file is found if a plugins folder does not already exist. <br />
 Copy and paste the 'MS_Utils' folder (delete '_Public-main' from the folder name) into that plugins folder. You may need to enable the plugin via Edit > Plugins from within your project.<br />
